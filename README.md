Notes:
 
 Ugly colors are intented to identify all app sections after Angular makes the changes in the UI.  ABout section use lots of HTML 5 tags and mediaqueries to allow responsiveness

 Next step:  Apply Bootstrap to make the UI beauty!

 Note:  Not SOLID principles applied and not Angular Architectural  best ptractices applied.. just for fun  and show in an easy way the best features of Angular
