Use of Directives, property Binding, Interpolation, event binding
<br><br>
    Automatic format number with directive <br>
    <br>
    Not sure how it could work while user types to reformat same entry without disturb user typing.. 
    <br>
    Here is as  how I would doit:
    <br>
    <input type="number"  [(ngModel)]="price" (blur)="doSomething()" >
    <br>
    <input type="text"  [appAutoformatnumber]="price" readonly>
    <br>
    Interpolation: {{ price }}
